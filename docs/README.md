# WhatsApp-Like Communication Platform (whatsapp-clone-cpp)

This project aims to develop a comprehensive messaging application inspired by WhatsApp, utilizing socket programming principles for real-time communication in C++. The goal is to create a feature-rich platform with advanced functionalities such as text messaging, media sharing (images, documents), group chats, and status updates.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **include/**: Contains header files (.h/.hpp) for class declarations and interface definitions.
- **src/**: Contains source files (.cpp) for class implementations and the main program.
- **bin/**: Contains the compiled executable binaries for the server and client applications.
- **lib/**: (Optional) Directory for external libraries (if needed).
- **test/**: Contains test files for unit testing.
- **multimedia/**: Contains files related to handling multimedia content.
- **common/**: Contains shared files like message structures and constants.
- **docs/**: Contains project documentation, such as README files.
- **build/**: Directory for build output files generated during compilation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the server and client applications using a C++ compiler.
4. Run the compiled executables to start the server and client applications.

## Project Goals

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: Implement a robust architecture enabling real-time messaging between connected clients through a central server.
2. **Advanced Features**: Develop a plethora of features including text messaging, media sharing, status updates, and group chats.
3. **Security Enhancement**: Employ end-to-end encryption mechanisms to safeguard user privacy and ensure message integrity.
4. **User Interface Design**: Design a user-friendly interface with features like contact management, message notifications, chat history, and multimedia previews.
